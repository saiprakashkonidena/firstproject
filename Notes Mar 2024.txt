What is Cloud computing:
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing resources, such as IT infrastructure or data center over the internet. This model allows businesses to rent storage space or access software programs from a cloud service provider, instead of building and maintaining their own IT infrastructure or data center.

Advantages of CC
- cost
- Scalable
- Reliable
- Speed
- Productivity
- Performance
- Security

Types of Cloud:(cloud models)
Public cloud - Azure, AWS, etc
Private cloud - Comcast private cloud
Hybrid cloud - 

Types of cloud services:
PAAS - Platform as a service 	- AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, and Adobe Commerce, Azure Vnet
IAAS - Infra as a service	- Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Compute Engine, DB
SAAS - Software as a service	- Gmail, Slack, and Microsoft Office 365

What is Azure?
The Azure cloud platform is more than 200 products and cloud services designed to help you bring new solutions to life—to solve today’s challenges and create the future. Build, run, and manage applications across multiple clouds, on-premises, and at the edge, with the tools and frameworks of your choice.


Why Azure?
To create the infra and proceed with the development of the application. 

Types of VMs:
1. Windows vms - runs on windows os
	RDP (Remote Desktop connection)
2. Linux vms - runs on linux OS
   Flavours on linux vms - centos, ubuntu, kali linux, etc....
3. Openstacks - similar to linux vms, but difference in functionality

-- Azure is generally available in 52 regions around the world, with plans announced for 6 additional regions.

Azure Resource Group:
A resource group is a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. The resource group can include all the resources for the solution, or only those resources that you want to manage as a group.

Azure VM:
---------
An Azure virtual machine gives you the flexibility of virtualization without having to buy and maintain the physical hardware that runs it. However, you still need to maintain the virtual machine by performing tasks, such as configuring, patching, and installing the software that runs on it.

Installing nginx server on a vm:
sudo apt-get -y update
sudo apt-get -y install nginx
sudo systemctl status nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx
expose the port in networking on portal
custom -> http (allow the traffic)
then on browser http://ipaddr

Nginx server installed by here
After that, update the packages
sudo apt-get -y update

Now, installing docker with the below command:
sudo apt install docker.io
Once installation completed, check the status
it should be in running if the installation is successful.

ARM template:
-------------
To implement infrastructure as code for your Azure solutions, use Azure Resource Manager templates (ARM templates). The template is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file that defines the infrastructure and configuration for your project.

Example from a live project VM: (JSON file)

Azure Vnet
Subnet
App Gateway - Azure Application Gateway is a web traffic (OSI layer 7) load balancer that enables you to manage traffic to your web applications.
Load balancers - Load balancing refers to efficiently distributing incoming network traffic across a group of backend servers or resources.

--

When u get a subscription in real time, by default you will be provided with:
Vnet
Subnet
Subnet IPs will be used for different acitivities (application, DB team)

Application gateway
Azure Application Gateway can be used as an internal application load balancer or as an internet-facing application load balancer. An internet-facing application gateway uses public IP addresses. The DNS name of an internet-facing application gateway is publicly resolvable to its public IP address. As a result, internet-facing application gateways can route client requests from the internet.

CIDR(Classless Inter-Domain Routing) ranges table: https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/server/know-how/cidr-classless-inter-domain-routing/#:~:text=The%20binary%20notation%20%E2%80%93%20and%20the%20calculation%20method,in%20CIDR%20notation%20range%20from%200%20to%2032.

Vnet Peering:
-------------
Virtual network peering enables you to seamlessly connect two or more Virtual Networks in Azure. The virtual networks appear as one for connectivity purposes. The traffic between virtual machines in peered virtual networks uses the Microsoft backbone infrastructure. Like traffic between virtual machines in the same network, traffic is routed through Microsoft's private network only.

Azure supports the following types of peering:

Virtual network peering: Connecting virtual networks within the same Azure region.

Global virtual network peering: Connecting virtual networks across Azure regions.

DB conenction string encryption:
--------------------------------
Using base64
echo "connection string" | base64 -d
echo "connection string" | base64

NSG:
----
A network security group (NSG) is a networking filter (firewall) containing a list of security rules allowing or denying network traffic to resources connected to Azure VNets. These rules can manage both inbound and outbound traffic. NSGs can be associated to subnets and/or individual Network Interfaces attached to ARM VMs and Classic VMs. Each NSG has the following properties regardless of where it is associated:

Name for the NSG
Azure region where the NSG is located
resource group
Rules either Inbound or Outboard defining what traffic is allowed or denied

ASG:
----
Normally when you deploy a network security group (NSG) it is either assigned to a NIC or a subnet (preferred). If you deploy that NSG to a subnet then the rules apply to all of the NICs, or virtual machines, in that subnet. This is OK when you’re deploying a new system where you can easily place virtual machines into subnets, and treat each subnet as its own security zone. But in the real world, things aren’t always that clean, and you might need something that allows a more dynamic or flexible means of assigning rules to some machines in a subnet.

An application security group allows you to logically group a number of virtual machine NICs from the same virtual network and apply a network security group (NSG) rule to them.

Route Table:
------------
In Azure, a route table contains a set of rules, called routes, that determine where network traffic is directed. Each route within a table specifies a destination IP address range and a next hop type, which can be a virtual appliance, virtual network gateway, internet, or none.

Azure Traffic manager:
----------------------
Azure Traffic Manager is a DNS-based traffic load balancer. This service allows you to distribute traffic to your public facing applications across the global Azure regions. Traffic Manager also provides your public endpoints with high availability and quick responsiveness.

---- Using Azure load balancer, how to distribute the load to the health servers?

Create 3 VMs
Install any service on top of it
Check the status of the service
Enable the HTTP port and ensure it is accessible in browser
Create a load balancer 


Email with the list of live tasks - infra side
share the plan to setup applcation
check list to share on email - rke and aks
Resume on email
